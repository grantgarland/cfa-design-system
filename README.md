<h1 align="center">Chick-fil-A® Web Design System</h1>

The Chick-fil-A® Web Design System is a collection of primitive and dynamic React UI components, typographies, colors, logos, and branding widgets for use in React web applications.

These components are the current recommended stardard for UI application development, although teams are always free to adopt any strategy they determine to exemplify our Chick-fil-A Core Values.

# **Core Design Principles**

- **Branding Guidelines**
> Establishing branding guidelines for Chick-fil-A is crucial for maintaining a consistent brand identity across all applications. This includes defining the color palette, typography, and logo usage. For example, the color palette should always include red, white, and black, while the typography could be limited to specific font families and sizes, depending upon the application target audience. Consistent usage of the Chick-fil-A logo across all applications is imperative.

- **UI Components**
> Developing a library of reusable UI components is essential for creating consistent user interfaces. Design components include buttons, forms, pickers and navigation menus. Components are designed to be flexible and easily customizable, but also strictly adhere to the branding constraints. For example, our button components offer numerous size and style options, but always use the Chick-fil-A color palette and typography.

- **Accessibility**
> Ensuring that all components in the design system are accessible is critical for providing a pleasurable user experience for all users. Accessibility considerations include using proper HTML tagging and ARIA attributes, as well as i18n configurability. As well, interactive components should utilize the proper focus states and keyboard accessibility options.

* **User Experience Guidelines**
> Defining user experience guidelines is important for creating a consistent user flow and ensuring that applications are intuitive and easy to use. Guidelines include layout, spacing, and prompt widgets. For example, the Design System questionnaire layout provides a consistent yet configurable workflow that includes a consistent placement of navigation menus and call-to-action buttons with dyanamic question types (rater, true/false, free-form, multiple choice, etc.).

* **Documentation**
> Providing clear and comprehensive documentation for the design system is crucial for spurring adoption and ensuring that all teams needs are met in using the components and guidelines effectively. Documentation should include usage instructions, code snippets, and examples. For example, a button component should have clear documentation on how to customize the text, size, and style, as well as examples of alternative usage states.

* **Testing**
> Developing and implementing a testing strategy for the design system must adhere to and maintain the highest standard, and at all times ensure a working instance of design components. Testing should include unit tests for individual components, StoryBook links to component variant testing, and integration tests for the system as a whole. 
 

* **Communication**
> Establishing clear communication channels for discussions around the design system is necessary to ensure that all teams' needs are met, and serve as a platform to share knowledge and feedback. This could include but is not limited to a dedicated Slack channel, quarterly design forums, or regular developer suveys.
